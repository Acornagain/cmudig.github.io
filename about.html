<h2>Our Values</h2>

ðŸš§ Work in Progress ðŸš§

<p class="measure-wide">
  <strong>People matter.</strong> Teams are more successful when everybody is
  happy. We are all human and strive for an inclusive environment. We care about
  work-life balance. We celebrate successes and learn from failures.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide">
  <strong>Simple but not easy.</strong> We strive to find simple solutions and
  principles to solve complex problem. Finding simple solutions doesn't mean
  it's easy but it means that the end result is usable and clearly communicated.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide">
  <strong>Execution matters.</strong> There are a lot of good ideas but a good
  idea only becomes a successful idea when it is well-executed and clearly
  communicated. We care about meaningful impact.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide">
  <strong>Pragmatism over dogmatism.</strong> Break rules when you have to and
  adjust your principles when it doesn't match reality.
</p>

<p class="measure-wide">
  <strong>We don't live in a bubble.</strong> Scientists can't be in a bubble.
  We have to care about the societal, ecological, and economical impact of our
  work. We have to help fight discrimination, climate change, and poverty.

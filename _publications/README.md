# Adding a publication

Create a new `*.html` file in the `_publications` directory. Pick a short key as your filename. Complete the file with the following basic format.

```html
---
layout: publication
title: ...
...
---
Abstract
```

Add the other properties (title, authors, etc). Take for example the Draco paper page.

There exists a gap between visualization design guidelines and their application
in visualization tools. While empirical studies can provide design guidance, we
lack a formal framework for representing design knowledge, integrating results
across studies, and applying this knowledge in automated design tools that
promote effective encodings and facilitate visual exploration. We propose
modeling visualization design knowledge as a collection of constraints, in
conjunction with a method to learn weights for soft constraints from
experimental data. Using constraints, we can take theoretical design knowledge
and express it in a concrete, extensible, and testable form: the resulting
models can recommend visualization designs and can easily be augmented with
additional constraints or updated weights. We implement our approach in Draco, a
constraint-based system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP). We demonstrate
how to construct increasingly sophisticated automated visualization design
systems, including systems based on weights learned directly from the results of
graphical perception experiments.

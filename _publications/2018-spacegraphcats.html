Genomes computationally inferred from large metagenomic data sets are often
incomplete and may be missing functionally important content and strain
variation. We introduce an information retrieval system for large metagenomic
data sets that exploits the sparsity of DNA assembly graphs to efficiently
extract subgraphs surrounding an inferred genome. We apply this system to
recover missing content from genome bins and show that substantial genomic se-
quence variation is present in a real metagenome. Our software implementation is
available at https://github.com/spacegraphcats/ spacegraphcats under the
